## Sample: Copper ✔ ️

Copper is a new material used to make armor, tools, and other unique items. It should function a lot like iron: 
spawn naturally as an ore, be smeltable, and form blocks, nuggets, etc. We can discuss all the uses later; for now, 
we can just get its spawning/basic use working.

## Alder Leaves ✔

things properly.
